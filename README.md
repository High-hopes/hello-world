Hello fellow coders.

I have had a interest in learning to program for a long time.
Mostly so I could develop mods for the games I play.
I'd purchased a few books on html and web design but ran into issues.
Then I tried learning Java on my own using sources like code academy. 
Having taken a Java course at my local college I am now again attempting to self teach. 
Simply with a foundation beneath me now.
